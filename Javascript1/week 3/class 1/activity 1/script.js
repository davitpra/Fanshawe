//3.- Create the following constants:
const HST_TAX = 0.13
const CHOCOLATE_COOKIE_PRICE = 3.99
const PEANUT_COOKIE_PRICE = 4.99

//4.- Prompt the user for the number of each cookie they would like.

var chocolateCookies = parseInt(prompt ('How many chocolate cookies would you like?'))

var peanutButterCookies = parseInt(prompt ('How many peanut butter cookies would you like?'))

//5.- Calculate the subtotal for all ordered cookies, and store the number in an appropriately

var subTotal = (chocolateCookies* CHOCOLATE_COOKIE_PRICE + peanutButterCookies*PEANUT_COOKIE_PRICE)

//6.- Calculate the amount of tax on the order using the constant
var tax = (subTotal*HST_TAX)

//7.- calculate the total price

var total = subTotal + tax

//8.- Calculate how many boxes are needed for the cookies. Each box can hold 6 cookies. Make sure we only have full boxes

var boxes = Math.floor((chocolateCookies + peanutButterCookies) / 6)

//9.- Any cookies that donâ€™t fit into a box go into individual bags, save the number of bags needed using an appropriately named variable.

var individualBags = (chocolateCookies + peanutButterCookies)%6

//10.- Output to the console the following and show all dollar values to 2 decimal places.

console.log(`Custumer Full Name: ${firtName} ${lastName}`)
